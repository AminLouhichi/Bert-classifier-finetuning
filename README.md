Legal-CamemBERT-finetuning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning the maastrichtlawtech/legal-camembert-base
 model on a multiclass text classification task in the legal domain.

The project demonstrates how to adapt a pretrained language model to classify legal texts into multiple categories, with training, evaluation, and inference pipelines included.
